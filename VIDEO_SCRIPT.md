### 0:00 - 0:25 | Intro & The Problem
**[Action: Show the TruthShield Landing Page]**
"This is TruthShield. In modern medicine, 80% of patients withhold critical information due to shame or fear of judgment. We built TruthShield as an anonymous 'Honesty Layer' to bridge that gap using MedGemma-4B Edge AI."

"The app is divided into two distinct views: the **Patient Honesty Portal** and the **Clinician Dashboard**."

### 0:25 - 1:15 | Patient Portal & AI Personalization
**[Action: Scroll to the 'Your Story' box in the Patient Portal]**
"Let's look at a common scenario: An adolescent patient presenting with fatigue, masking a deeper issue of cyberbullying."

**[Action: Click '🚀 Try Demo Scenarios' and select 'Cyberbullying 📱']**
"With one click, the portal is populated. Notice how the clinical notes describe it as 'typical adolescent adjustment.' But watch what happens when the patient submits their story."

**[Action: Click 'Submit Story & Personalize My Survey']**
"Instantly, MedGemma analyzes the narrative and generates a **Deep Diagnostic Check-in**. It's not a static form—these are 10 nuanced, interactive questions specifically generated for this patient's situation."

**[Action: Scroll through the 10 MCQs, highlighting the 'DEPARTMENT' badge]**
"TruthShield even maps the case to the correct clinical department—in this case, Pediatrics. The patient can now provide clear, 3-point clinical signals on their own terms, 100% offline and privately."

### 1:15 - 2:00 | Clinician Analysis & Truth Discovery
**[Action: Switch to the 'Clinician Dashboard' tab]**
"Now, let's step into the clinician's shoes. We've received the anonymous survey. The initial EHR notes only mention 'moody behavior,' but the survey reveals the masked truth: severe social distress and somatic pain."

**[Action: Click '🔍 Run TruthShield Analysis']**
"When we run the TruthShield Analysis, MedGemma compares the clinical notes against the honesty portal data. In under 100 milliseconds, we get a clinical alert."

**[Action: Point to the 'TruthShield Clinical Alert' box]**
"It flags the discrepancy. It explains the clinical reasoning. And most importantly, it provides the **Suggested Approach**—the exact words I can use to open up this conversation safely with my patient."

### 2:00 - 2:30 | Technical Edge & Closing
**[Action: Show the 'Advanced Configuration' or 'Settings' briefly]**
"TruthShield runs entirely on the edge using 4 Billion MedGemma parameters. It’s tablet-ready, SNOMED-CT coded, and ready for EHR integration via HL7 FHIR bundles."

**[Action: Back to the Landing Page/Logo]**
"With TruthShield, we aren't just treating symptoms; we're discovering the person behind the story. This is the future of empathetic, data-driven medicine. Built for the MedGemma Impact Challenge 2026."
